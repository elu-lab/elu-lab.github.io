    abstract = {Acquiring simple arithmetic skills at the preschool level requires repetitive practices. One method for encouraging students to spend longer time practicing is by presenting the skills in an engaging game. As student retention on the game increases, the student will be more likely to acquire the practiced skill since she will have spent more time practicing. In this paper, we examine the relationship between internal locus of control and retention in game-based learning applications for young children using Todo Math, a mobile-based math learning application for children from Pre-K to 2nd grade. We examine 345,783 users' log data to show that when children prefer "free" mode, which has high internal locus of control, their retention on Todo Math is higher than children who prefer "daily" mode, which has high external locus of control. We present three analyses that support our findings using survival analysis, post-hoc analysis, and t-test.},

    abstract = {There has been a growing concern over the huge increase in use of smart media by young children. This study explores the possibility of using augmented-reality(AR) for regulat-ing preschoolers' media usage behavior. With MABLE (mobile application for behavioral learning and education), parents can provide AR-assisted feedback by changing facial expressions and sound effects. When overlaying a smart media, which has MABLE running, in front of a QR marker on a puppet, a facial expression is displayed on top of the puppet's face. A two-week long experiment with 36 parent-child pairs showed that compared to using just the puppet, using MABLE showed higher amount of engage-ment among preschoolers. For the effectiveness of parental mediation in terms of self-control, our data showed mixed results. MABLE had positive effects in that the amount of rule-compliance increased and problematic behaviors de-creased, whereas the level of behavioral dependency on smart media was not influenced.},

    abstract = {A learner's guessing behavior while playing educational games can be a key indicator of her disengagement that impacts learning negatively. To distinguish a learner's guessing behavior from solution behavior, we present an explorative study of using motion features, which represent a learner's finger movements on a tablet screen. Our data was collected from the Missing Number game of KitKit School, a tablet-based math game designed for children from pre-K to grade 2 in elementary school. A total of 5,040 problem solving logs, which were collected from 168 students, were analyzed. A two-sample t-test showed a significant difference between guessing and solution behavior for four groups of motion features that indicate distance, curvedness, complexity, and pause (p&lt;0.001). Additionally, our empirical results showed the possibility of using motion features in automatic detection of guessing behavior. Our best model yielded an accuracy of 0.778 and AUC value of 0.851 by using the random forest classifier.},

    abstract = "Solving algebraic word problems has recently emerged as an important natural language processing task. To solve algebraic word problems, recent studies suggested neural models that generate solution equations by using {`}Op (operator/operand){'} tokens as a unit of input/output. However, such a neural model suffered two issues: expression fragmentation and operand-context separation. To address each of these two issues, we propose a pure neural model, Expression-Pointer Transformer (EPT), which uses (1) {`}Expression{'} token and (2) operand-context pointers when generating solution equations. The performance of the EPT model is tested on three datasets: ALG514, DRAW-1K, and MAWPS. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SoTA) models, the EPT model achieved a comparable performance accuracy in each of the three datasets; 81.3{\%} on ALG514, 59.5{\%} on DRAW-1K, and 84.5{\%} on MAWPS. The contribution of this paper is two-fold; (1) We propose a pure neural model, EPT, which can address the expression fragmentation and the operand-context separation. (2) The fully automatic EPT model, which does not use hand-crafted features, yields comparable performance to existing models using hand-crafted features, and achieves better performance than existing pure neural models by at most 40{\%}.",

Recently, to address the math word problem-solving task, researchers have applied the encoder-decoder architecture, which is mainly used in machine translation tasks. The state-of-the-art neural models use hand-crafted features and are based on generation methods. In this paper, we propose the GEO (Generation of Equations by utilizing Operators) model that does not use hand-crafted features and addresses two issues that are present in existing neural models: 1. missing domain-specific knowledge features and 2. losing encoder-level knowledge. To address missing domain-specific feature issue, we designed two auxiliary tasks: operation group difference prediction and implicit pair prediction. To address losing encoder-level knowledge issue, we added an Operation Feature Feed Forward (OP3F) layer. Experimental results showed that the GEO model outperformed existing state-of-the-art models on two datasets, 85.1{\%} in MAWPS, and 62.5{\%} in DRAW-1K, and reached comparable performance of 82.1{\%} in ALG514 dataset.",

    abstract = "Background: Research on problematic internet use has focused on devising diagnostic criteria or describing the factors that influence internet overuse. However, a paradigm shift is necessary in studying the phenomenon of increased internet use not just from a pathological point of view but also from a developmental point of view that considers children's behavior of adapting to a technology-oriented society. Objective: In this paper, we propose the Cyclic Value-Context Reinforcement Model (CVCRM) to understand problematic internet use behavior. The purpose of our study was to construct a developmental process model that provides a holistic understanding of problematic internet use behavior of children and to empirically validate the proposed model by conducting a thematic analysis on actual counseling data. Methods: To validate the CVCRM, we conducted thematic analysis using the counseling data from 312 Korean children aged 7-18 years. For the coding process, 7 master's and doctoral student researchers participated as coders, and 2 professors supervised the coding process and results. Results: This project was funded from October 2015 to September 2019 to analyze counseling data from 312 children who participated in counseling sessions during January 2012 to May 2014. Based on the data analysis, we present the CVCRM, which integrates existing theoretical approaches and encompasses the 3 interacting aspects that induce and reinforce problematic internet use in children: psychosocial value, environmental context, and internet utility. Specifically, using counseling data, we empirically ascertained that problematic internet use behavior feeds into children's psychosocial values and environmental contexts, which in turn facilitates problematic internet use in a cyclical manner. Conclusions: Through this empirical validation, the CVCRM can provide a theoretical framework and an integrated perspective on the developmental mechanism of problematic internet use behavior of children.

To build a robust model that can sufficiently utilize numeric information to solve various mathematical word problems, such a model should address two challenges: (1) filling in missing world knowledge required to solve the given mathematical word problem, and (2) understanding the implied relationship between numbers and variables. To address these two challenges, we propose template-based multitask generation (TM-generation). To address challenge (1), we utilize the state-of-the-art language models called ELECTRA. To address challenge (2), we propose an operator identification layer that models the relationship between numbers and variables.

In this work, we propose a new experimental method using simulated data and a series of statistical tests to verify the metric{'}s soundness. Our experimental result revealed that all existing metrics such as Smatch, SemBLEU, S2match, Smatch++, WWLK-theta, WWLK-k3e2n, and SEMA did not fully meet the AMR guidelines in terms of equivalence and inequivalence aspects. Also, to alleviate this soundness problem, we suggest a revised metric called Smatch{\#}, which adopts simple graph standardization technique that can improve the soundness of an existing metric.",
